# Where do we fit?

# Monitoring Team

## Composed by 2 teams that collaborate in certain projects

#### <span style="color:#EE0000;">In-Cluster</span> Team
- Responsible for the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) which is a core operator of OpenShift in charge all things monitoring
- Responsible for the monitoring + alerting side of the Observability Operator (OO) which is an operator whose primary responsibility is to collect, process and forward observability signals but isn't in the business of providing a highly-scalable observability store.

## Composed by 2 teams that collaborate in certain projects

#### <span style="color:#EE0000;">Observatorium Team</span> (aka RHOBS Team)
- Responsible for the Observatorium project allows you to run and operate effectively a multi-tenant, easy-to-operate, scalable open-source observability system on Kubernetes.
- Responsible for providing Observability as a Service (aka RHOBS). The goal is to create a service that in-house teams can use and instead of them maintaining an observability stack on their side, they simply forward data to said service.

# Team Dynamics

## What work meeting do we have? How do we bond?

#### Work meetings

- 2 weekly team sync meetings to report and unblock progress, they are however not mandatory but you should report news from time to time.
- 1 sprint retrospective meeting to report what was accomplished during the sprint and show your plan for the next sprint
- 1 sprint review meeting with the observability group to review the team's biggest achievements and showcase demos
- Weekly 1-on-1 with manager and with team lead and/or mentor

---

## What work meeting do we have? How do we bond?

#### Team bonding meetings

- Show and/or Tell: (usually a sprintely) forum where a member of the team monitoring shares a blog post, article, video, or anythingâ€¦ they found insightful
- Happy Hour: a weekly meeting on Tuesday where we save 1 hour of our day to simply chat about anything with our in-cluster team members.
- Monitoring Team Virtual Pub Happy Hour: a weekly meeting on Friday afternoon where we share a beer and get ready for the weekend.

## How do we interact with users? How to ask for help?

#### User interaction

- Users ask questions on #forum-monitoring. We follow a rotating schedule where two members of the team are responsible for replying to users a day per week
- Weekly rotation on bug triage is known as bug boss duty where a member of the team will be responsible for triaging the bugs for the week
- It's always ok to ask the help of senior members when you don't know the answer ðŸ˜‰

---

## How do we interact with users? How to ask for help?

#### Asking for help

- #team-monitoring is the defacto for asking for help, if you @team-monitoring all members of the in-cluster team will be notified
- #observability-team is the channel when you want to involve members from outside the team but in the observability space
- #forum-monitoring is where users usually ask for help but we can use it as well (and the answer might even be quicker).
- Directly reach out to a member of the team (but don't expect an immediate response)

# Team Context

## 4.12 release to consolidate features and support HyperShift through Observability Operator

- We are a no-feature freeze team, this means we only stop coding features by code freeze and not by feature freeze, see [OpenShift calendar for dates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bRYespPb-AvclkwkoizmJ6NZ54p9iFRn6DGD8Ugv2c/edit?usp=sharing).
- Throughout 4.11 the team saw 3 engineers leaving and 2 engineers joining.
- In 4.11 a lot of features were introduced so in 4.12 the plan of the team is to not overcommit and consolidate most of the features introduced.
- HyperShift is a middleware for hosting OpenShift control planes at a scale that solves cost and time to provision.
- Our team is responsible for supporting the Observability Operator (OO) the goal is to eventually be deployed in the data plane nodes of HyperShift clusters and forward data to Observatorium.
