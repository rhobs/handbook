## Service Level Agreement

![SLO](../../../assets/slo-def.png)

If you manage [“Observatorium”](../observatorium.md) the Service Level Objectives can go ultra high in all dimensions like availability, and data loss. The freshness aspect for read APIs is trickier as among other things it also depends on client collection pipeline availability which is out of Observatorium scope.

RHOBS as Observatorium as a Service has currently established following, default, Service Level Objectives. This is based on infrastructure dependencies we have listed [here (intenral)](https://visual-app-interface.devshift.net/services#/services/rhobs/app.yml).

> NOTE: We envision more granular tiers of SLO in future for different tenants, for better QoS levels. Currently, all tenants has the same SLOs.
