# Observatorium

Observatorium is an observability system designed to enable the ingestion, storage (short and long term) and querying capabilities for three major observability signals: metrics, logging and tracing. It unifies horizontally scalable, multi-tenant systems like Thanos, Loki, and in the future, Jaeger to deploy them in a single stack with consistent APIs. On top of that it's designed to be managed as a service thanks to consistent tenancy, authorization and rate limiting across all three signals.

### Our Usage

We use Observatorium as a Service for our [Red Hat Observability Service (RHOBS)](../../Services/RHOBS).

We also know of several other companies installing Observatorium on their own (as of 2021.07.07):

* RHACM
* Managed Tenants until they can get access to RHBOBS (e.g. Kafka Team)
* IBM
* GitPod
